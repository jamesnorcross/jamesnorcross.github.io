    "text": "Review the sample projects in ISLR and suggest data project examples using your own experience and data\nIn 2019, several local governments across the United States experienced a cyber-attack using some variation of Ransomware. While the attacks appeared largely at random, a question remains if certain organizational factors of local government targets influenced the selection by the Threat Actors.\na. Present a proposed hypothesis:\nOverall Question:  Does budget or personnel allocation influence a Threat Actor’s cyber-attack target selection decision?\nOverall Hypothesis:  Budget and personnel allocation do play a role in influencing a Threat Actor’s cyber-attack target selection decision.\nb. How data can be collected?\nCyber-attack data:  Seculore.com actively collects data on all publicly reported cyber-attacks in the United States.  They store this information in an easily accessible database on their website.  The categorize the information into different target designations, one of which is “government.”  A list of all local governments nation-wide that experienced a Ransomware attack in 2019 can be collected.\nLocal Govt Data:  Many local governments post their budget and personnel data, online their organization website.  A complete annual budget will have total government budget, individual department budgets, and personnel assignments and allocation for each department.\nc. What methods could be considered?\nData Collection: SecurLore Solutions data may be able to be data mined, but most government budget data is included in PDF forms and will require downloads and actual data collection by hand.\nData Consolidation: The collected data can then be consolidated to a single form.\nData Analysis: The data table can then be imported into R-suite or STATA for analysis.\nd. How to start the data project?\nBy the formulation of the question and hypothesis and developing a plan such as this, is the start of the data project. Next, would involve the initial collection of the rough data to be sorted through and then inputted into a single, data table for eventual importing and analysis."

    "text": "Comparison Article Review:\nBreiman, L. (2001). Statistical modeling: The two Cultures. Statistical Science, 16(3), 199-231. https://doi.org/10.1214/ss/1009213726\nShmueli, G. (2010). To explain or to predict? Statistical Science, 25(3), 289-310. https://doi.org/10.1214/10-STS330\n            Reading through both articles was pretty insightful and concerning at the same time. Breiman (2001) points out well the overuse of modeling, not only in the statistical sciences (S.S.), but also in other disciplines as well.  It seems that S.S. is having a significant influence on the statistical methods being used in academic research, throughout most disciplines. This influence is the overusage of statistical modeling versus other methodologies; to such the extent that it has become more about the model than the data.\n            Shmueli (2010) takes a different approach by indicating that the statistical sciences are influenced by the other academic disciplines in developing statistical models that can be used in research. Shmueli (2010) mentions the influence of as the basis of why S.S. cannot \"go its own way\" in developing its own unique methods in which the focus is on the data and  not the model.\n            While I found both arguments reasonable, I found Shmueli's much less compelling.  As a research scholar in the field of Public Affairs, I am expected to produce publishable research using common statistical methods that interpret the mean of data as compared to relevant theory.  However, according to an article by Mergel et al. (2016) the use of \"Big Data\" in Public Affairs (P.A.) research is often improperly done.  Computation methods and models are utilized by P.A. scholars, many times in the wrong way, producing incorrect results from the data (Mergel et al., 2016). This, from my perspective, hurts Shmueli's argument about other academic fields influencing model and algorithmic progression in the field of Statistical Science.  Additionally, why I can see the influence that academic fields may have on one another, there is no excuse for any one or several fields control the research and development of any other field.  Independent fields stand alone because of their uniqueness and the fact they contribute to the body of total scholarly knowledge, separating from other fields.  If a field is controlled to such a point that it limits its progression, then is that field truly independent or is it just a subspecialty of another field?\n            While I appreciate both scholar's argument, I find myself agreeing more with Breiman with their perspective that the field of Statistical Science needs to look beyond the basis of a model and look more towards methods that best fit the data at hand, to provide a proper interpretation of its meaning.  While I can also see Shmueli's perspective that the field of Statistical Science needs to work cooperative with the family of other academic disciplines, it almost must maintain its own independence to develop itself and the proper means to compute and interpret data.\nReference:\nMergel, I., Rethemeyer, K., & Isett, K.
