As there is a limited amount of research in this area of inquiry in the general field of Public Affairs, there are numerous conceptual areas I’m investigating; some of these areas are:\n\nLocal government spending and budget allocation following a cyber-attack.\nEvaluating cyber-threats focused on local governments and nonprofit organizations.\nThe role of capital investment spending in supporting local governments’ financial recovery from a cyber-attack.\nInvestigating current research in fields outside of Public Affairs that may be used to develop cybersecurity management strategies to improve local government and nonprofit cybersecurity resiliency."
