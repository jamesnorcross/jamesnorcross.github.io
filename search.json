Norcross and I am currently a final year Doctoral Candidate in the Public and Nonprofit Management program in the field of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Dallas. I am also a full-time faculty in the Department of Cybersecurity in the School of ETMS at Dallas College. I teach courses in Cybersecurity, Computer Information Systems, and the use of AI/ML in these fields. Upon completing my PhD, it is my intent to seek a position with a university in the Northeast region of the United States to be closer to family and to have a chance of seeing snow in the winter season. This webpage was developed to show my work and as part of my ongoing studies in the field of Data Science for Social Sciences. If you wish to contact me regarding any of my material on this webpage or my future career plans, please feel free to connect with me at:\nEmail: James.Norcross@UTDallas.edu"

    "text": "My area of research is Cybersecurity and Information Systems, particularly as applied local governments and nonprofit organizations. As there is a limited amount of research in this area of inquiry in the general field of Public Affairs, there are numerous conceptual areas I’m investigating; some of these areas are:\n\nLocal government spending and budget allocation following a cyber-attack.\nEvaluating cyber-threats focused on local governments and nonprofit organizations.\nThe role of capital investment spending in supporting local governments’ financial recovery from a cyber-attack.\nInvestigating current research in fields outside of Public Affairs that may be used to develop cybersecurity management strategies to improve local government and nonprofit cybersecurity resiliency."
